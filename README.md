# Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Chronic Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Prediction with Correlated Feature Selection 
Developed a ML model for predicting PCOS based on demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters.
Collected data from Kaggle that included information on age, body mass index, menstrual cycle length, follicle-stimulating hormone, hair growth, etc.
Used this data to train several traditional ML and ensemble algorithms.
